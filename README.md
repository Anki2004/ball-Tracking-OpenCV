# QuadBall Tracker 🔴🟢🔵🟡

## 🎥 Visual Ball Tracking Across Quadrants

QuadBall Tracker is an exciting computer vision project that brings the magic of object tracking to life! This Python-based application takes a video input and tracks colored balls as they move across different quadrants of the frame. It's like having a digital referee for your very own multi-dimensional game of catch!

### 🌟 Features

- 🔍 Detects and tracks balls of different colors (red, green, blue, yellow)
- 🏁 Divides the video frame into four quadrants
- 📊 Records entry and exit events for each ball in every quadrant
- ⏱️ Provides timestamped data for all tracked events
- 🎨 Works with multiple ball colors simultaneously

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Video Input**: Feed in your video of balls bouncing around.
2. **Color Detection**: Our smart algorithms detect balls of different colors.
3. **Quadrant Mapping**: The video frame is split into four quadrants.
4. **Event Tracking**: The system records when balls enter or exit each quadrant.
5. **Data Output**: Get a detailed log of all ball movements!
